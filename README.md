# INTUITIVE-AUGMENTED-GRAPHICAL-PASSWORD-AUTHENTICATION-SYSTEM
This project enhances authentication using graphical passwords and the SURF algorithm to extract image features for secure login. Users select points in an image as a password, repeating the sequence for access. This recognition-based approach provides a fast, user-friendly, and secure alternative to traditional text passwords.
